## 2026-03-27 — Minify CSS/JS for Production

**What:** Generated minified versions of `styles.css` and `scripts.js` using clean-css-cli and terser. Updated `index.html` to reference the `.min.css` and `.min.js` files. Originals kept for editing.

**Result:**
- `css/styles.css` (41.1KB) → `css/styles.min.css` (28.6KB) — **30% reduction**
- `js/scripts.js` (44.6KB) → `js/scripts.min.js` (26.6KB) — **40% reduction**
- Combined savings: **~30KB** off page load

**Files changed:**
- `css/styles.min.css` (new)
- `js/scripts.min.js` (new)
- `index.html` — updated `<link>` and `<script>` to point to minified files

**Note:** Edit the original `.css`/`.js` files, then re-minify before deploy.

- `js/scripts.js` — all `.png"` → `.webp"`
- `site/js/scripts.js` — all `.png"` → `.webp"`

**Tool:** Python PIL (WEBP quality=82, method=6, max dim 1200px LANCZOS resize)

## 2026-03-26 — Image Compression: JPG → WebP

## 2026-03-27 — Performance: Added `loading="lazy"` to gallery images

**What:** Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to project cards and lightbox image elements in `js/scripts.js` and `site/js/scripts.js`.

**Why:** Improves initial page load performance and reduces data usage by only loading images as they are needed (when they enter the viewport or are viewed in the lightbox). This is especially important for portfolios with many high-quality renders.

**Files changed:**
- `js/scripts.js` — Added `loading="lazy"` to project card images and `img.setAttribute('loading', 'lazy')` to the lightbox updater.
- `site/js/scripts.js` — Same.

## 2026-03-27 — Add Meta Description Tag for SEO

**What:** Added `<meta name="description">` tag to both `index.html` and `site/index.html`.

**Content:**
> "Mark Hintz — Mechanical designer and automation engineer specializing in SolidWorks, AI-driven tooling, and industrial system design. Based in Jacksonville, FL."

**Why:** Without a description tag, search engines and link unfurls (LinkedIn, Slack, etc.) generate unpredictable previews. This locks in a clean, professional blurb.

**Files changed:**
- `index.html` — added meta description after viewport tag
- `site/index.html` — same
